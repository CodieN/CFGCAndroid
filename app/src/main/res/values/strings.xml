    <string name="this_box_is_going_to_contain_text_from_azalea_tour_website_with_current_year_theme">
        Come enjoy Southern hospitality amid the vibrant color of azaleas and spring flowers
        during the 67th Annual Cape Fear Garden Club Azalea Garden Tour© in the beautiful
        coastal community of Wilmington, North Carolina. An official event of the North Carolina
        Azalea Festival, the tour is one of the longest running and most popular garden tours in
        the South.

        \n\nProceeds from the Cape Fear Garden Club Azalea Garden Tour© are
        reinvested in the community through beautification and horticultural grants within New
        Hanover County, scholarships at the University of North Carolina Wilmington and Cape
        Fear Community College, and conservation efforts at Battery Island, a National Audubon
        Society bird sanctuary. The club has granted over $1 million in donations to the community
        in the past 61 years.

        Battery Island Committee highlights the
        twenty-three-year relationship that The Cape Fear Garden Club, Inc. has in
        working closely with Audubon NC’s Coastal Office and biologists to maintain safe
        habitats for the migratory birds, specifically the islands in the Lower Cape Fear
        River where they nest.

        \n\nThe Cape Fear Garden Club, Inc. assists Audubon in
        funding through a standing annual grant and through education outreach by
        sponsoring the annual Spring Cruise to the Bird Islands in the Lower Cape Fear
        River each May. This committee supports Audubon with cleanups on Battery
        Island in the spring before nesting season begins and the fall after the nesting
        season is complete. Our main concern is to get debris that floats in off the Cape
        Fear River and specifically fishing line off the island because of the danger of
        entanglement of pelicans and other shorebirds. The Committee also does the
        detailed planning and coordination for The Cape Fear Garden Club for the
        Spring Cruise to the Bird Islands in the Lower Cape Fear River.

        Several landscape installations throughout New Hanover County have been initiated by the Cape Fear Garden Club.

        \n\nAIRLIE SHOWCASE GARDEN
        \nAirlie Showcase Garden was born in 2006 with an Asian design. Over time the garden had outgrown its borders.
        The idea of changing the garden to a Southern Garden was presented at the September 2015 General Meeting.
        In late winter of 2016 the Asian garden was torn out and the Southern Garden was completed in early April 2016.

        \n\nThe Southern Garden is filled with Encore Azaleas, Drift Roses, Endless Summer Hydrangeas, Yew Prostrata,
        and Drawf Larepetalum. The border for the garden is white Sasanqua Camellias. In the spring the garden has the
        sweet aroma of Confederate Jasmine which covers an arbor at the entrance. In addition to the plants there are two
        Red Maple trees that offer some shade. A slate walkway outlined with Dwarf Mondo grass leads to a white vineyard bench.

        \n\nThe garden has a different but tranquil feeling when it is lite during Enchanted Airlie in November and December
        each year. A committee of 20 Cape Fear Garden Club members maintain the Southern Garden through the year.

        \n\nBIRDS AND BUTTERFLIES Birds and Butterflies installs bluebird trails and butterfly gardens as the opportunity
        presents itself in the community, as well as assisting with community projects that relate to Birds and Butterflies.
        Bluebird trails include those at the Seaspray Landing community, in honor of Doris Ayers, a CFGC member, and the
        trail at River Bluffs, a low-impact development community overlooking the Cape Fear River. As a designated LID
        community, it provides a wetland area to temporarily store, filter and clean runoff water rather than using retention ponds.
        The provide habitat for many creatures such as birds, butterflies, bees, salamanders, toads and frogs.
        Bluebirds had taken up residence as of spring 2017 at both locations.

        \n\nAdditional committees focus on: civic improvements, such as tree canopy replacement after storms and Beauty
        Spot awards; conservation projects; gardening for wildlife, educating the public on how to create a wildlife habitat;
        and leading youth garden clubs, helping several local elementary schools plant wildlife habitats on their campus.

        Belle Mission Statement

        \n\nThe Cape Fear Garden Club, Inc. Azalea Belles© serve as ambassadors for
        The Cape Fear Garden Club, Inc., the North Carolina Azalea Festival and the City
        of Wilmington. This is a diverse group of young women dressed in colorful gowns
        that complement the blooms and surrounding landscapes of Wilmington, greet visitors
        to the Cape Fear Garden Club Azalea Garden Tour©, and participate in other events
        related to the North Carolina Azalea Festival.

        \n\nCriteria for being selected as an Azalea Belle:
        \n· Applications are accepted from young ladies who are in the 11th or 12th
        grade and who reside in or attend school in New Hanover County. Applications
        from surrounding counties are accepted, but are not given priority over New Hanover
        County applicants. (Daughters and granddaughters of CFGC members may reside out
        of the county.)
        \n· A young lady may only serve as a Belle one year.
        \n· A young lady who wishes to be a Belle may not participate in the Azalea
        Scholarship Pageant in the same year she serves as a Belle.

        \n\nUpdated information concerning The Cape Fear Garden Club, Inc. Azalea
