    <string name="this_box_is_going_to_contain_text_from_azalea_tour_website_with_current_year_theme">
        On behalf of the 401 members of the Cape Fear Garden Club, we thank you for joining us for
        the 2020 Azalea Garden Tour. The proceeds from the Garden Tour ticket sales are given back
        to our community each fall as grants to other non-profits for education, beautification and
        conservation of our native trees, plants and birds. As you make your way from garden
        to garden, you’ll pass by many beautiful spots around town: schools, parks, museums and
        roadways. There’s a good chance that through your purchase of an Azalea Garden Tour ticket,
        the Cape Fear Garden Club was able to enhance and preserve the beauty of many of these
        places in our community. Since 2003, the proceeds from the Azalea Garden Tour have
        supported local non-profits with grants from the Cape Fear Garden Club totaling over
        $1,209,000.

        Battery Island Committee highlights the
        twenty-three-year relationship that The Cape Fear Garden Club, Inc. has in
        working closely with Audubon NC’s Coastal Office and biologists to maintain safe
        habitats for the migratory birds, specifically the islands in the Lower Cape Fear
        River where they nest.

        \n\nThe Cape Fear Garden Club, Inc. assists Audubon in
        funding through a standing annual grant and through education outreach by
        sponsoring the annual Spring Cruise to the Bird Islands in the Lower Cape Fear
        River each May. This committee supports Audubon with cleanups on Battery
        Island in the spring before nesting season begins and the fall after the nesting
        season is complete. Our main concern is to get debris that floats in off the Cape
        Fear River and specifically fishing line off the island because of the danger of
        entanglement of pelicans and other shorebirds. The Committee also does the
        detailed planning and coordination for The Cape Fear Garden Club for the
        Spring Cruise to the Bird Islands in the Lower Cape Fear River.

        Several landscape installations throughout New Hanover County have been initiated by the Cape Fear Garden Club.

        \n\nAIRLIE SHOWCASE GARDEN
        \nAirlie Showcase Garden was born in 2006 with an Asian design. Over time the garden had outgrown its borders.
        The idea of changing the garden to a Southern Garden was presented at the September 2015 General Meeting.
        In late winter of 2016 the Asian garden was torn out and the Southern Garden was completed in early April 2016.

        \n\nThe Southern Garden is filled with Encore Azaleas, Drift Roses, Endless Summer Hydrangeas, Yew Prostrata,
        and Drawf Larepetalum. The border for the garden is white Sasanqua Camellias. In the spring the garden has the
        sweet aroma of Confederate Jasmine which covers an arbor at the entrance. In addition to the plants there are two
        Red Maple trees that offer some shade. A slate walkway outlined with Dwarf Mondo grass leads to a white vineyard bench.

        \n\nThe garden has a different but tranquil feeling when it is lite during Enchanted Airlie in November and December
        each year. A committee of 20 Cape Fear Garden Club members maintain the Southern Garden through the year.

        \n\nBIRDS AND BUTTERFLIES Birds and Butterflies installs bluebird trails and butterfly gardens as the opportunity
        presents itself in the community, as well as assisting with community projects that relate to Birds and Butterflies.
        Bluebird trails include those at the Seaspray Landing community, in honor of Doris Ayers, a CFGC member, and the
        trail at River Bluffs, a low-impact development community overlooking the Cape Fear River. As a designated LID
        community, it provides a wetland area to temporarily store, filter and clean runoff water rather than using retention ponds.
        The provide habitat for many creatures such as birds, butterflies, bees, salamanders, toads and frogs.
        Bluebirds had taken up residence as of spring 2017 at both locations.

        \n\nAdditional committees focus on: civic improvements, such as tree canopy replacement after storms and Beauty
        Spot awards; conservation projects; gardening for wildlife, educating the public on how to create a wildlife habitat;
        and leading youth garden clubs, helping several local elementary schools plant wildlife habitats on their campus.

        For almost 90 years the Cape Fear Garden Club has worked to enhance and support
        the natural beauty of Wilmington. In 2011, we created the Cape Fear Garden Club

        Our 67th Azalea Garden Tour opens with the spectacular Ribbon Cutting Ceremony. This event
        includes all of the 2020 Azalea Belles, the Citadel Summerall Guards, the North Carolina
        Azalea Festival Queen and celebrity guests. The Azalea Queen’s Garden Party will be held
        immediately following the Ribbon Cutting at this location.

        \n\nThis beautiful five-acre family estate truly reflects Southern charm and has been shared
        with this year’s Azalea Garden Tour for the ribbon cutting only. Located on a quiet lane it
        is an elegant refuge from traffic and noise. Large live oaks give filtered shade and leave
        patterns on the brick path. The home is a lovely soft yellow on the exterior with white trim
        and Charleston Green accents. Two story verandas adorn the front of the home and two story
        screen porches give year round appeal to experiencing the outdoors. A large guesthouse opens
        to the expansive pool complex and speaks to their love of entertaining with family and
        friends. Opposite the guest house and pool is a lovely pergola covered with Confederate
        jasmine. This garden says “Welcome Home,” the yard says “Kids Are Welcome.”

        \n\n<b>How To Get There:</b> Parking for the Ribbon Cutting is ONLY available at Hugh MacRae
        Park Shelter-4, 314 Pine Grove Drive. Free round-trip bus service from the park to the
        Ribbon Cutting is available from 8:00am to Noon.

        \n\n<i>Ribbon Cutting Garden is ONLY OPEN from 10:00am to Noon on Friday, NOT OPEN on Friday
            afternoon, Saturday or Sunday.</i>

        The owners take care of this luxuriant green space carpeted with native plants themselves
        and have created and maintained a natural haven since they arrived in 1966. It is just the
        sort of garden, sustainable both in cultivation and in maintenance, that birds and
        butterflies choose to make their home because feeders near the house never go empty.
        The plants cycle through the seasons, leaf debris accumulates then nurtures the soil.
        Mrs. Parnell says she would like to place a sign in the spring that says “Our flowers are
        not dead, they’re sleeping.” The owners’ intentions are to protect the native habitat that
        attracts the birds and butterflies. There are paths that wind through the property’s 3.67
        acres from the house through the vegetation. With the debris on the street piling up after
        Hurricane Florence, they decided to make piles of their fallen branches in the woods to
        provide habitat for forest creatures and birds. “Living quarters: everyone is invited” is
        the sign Mrs. Parnell would like to place there. This garden, itself, is a gift from the
        owners to the wildlife that inhabits their corner of Wilmington. Because it is sustainable
        and contains food, water, protective cover and places to raise young— all of which are
        essential to the preservation of wildlife— it is officially certified as a Natural Wildlife
        Habitat.

        \n\n<i>This property was named a Tree Award Winner by the Wilmington Tree Commission in 2019.</i>

        \n\n<b>How To Get There:</b> This garden can only be accessed by our free round-trip buses that
        circle between a parking facility and Gardens 1 &amp; 2 from 9:30am to 5:00pm.

        \n\nFriday: Park at Hugh MacRae Park, Shelter-4, 314 Pine Grove Drive, last bus to the
        garden will leave at 4:30pm.

        \n\nSaturday &amp; Sunday: Park at Bradley Creek Elementary School, 6211 Greenville Loop Road, last

        The pretty dual staircase at the entrance to this inviting yellow house is the centerpiece
        of extensive banks of colorful annual and perennial plantings that flow down to the
        Intracoastal Waterway. Around the back of the house is a backyard sports paradise for kids
        and adults as well as a place for relaxation afterwards around the cozy fire pit, adjacent
        pool and outdoor kitchen. The owners built their home and garden from an empty lot in 2001.
        They kept a list whenever traveling of favorite things about each vacation spot, and when it
        came time to build they incorporated many of these ideas: the sun-shelf on the pool, shaded
        day bed, secluded outdoors shower with a view to the Intracoastal Waterway, and outdoor
        kitchen. Three years ago, they renewed the backyard design including a new water feature,
        a pool and another fun vacation memory: multi-colored lights within the pool that glow
        softly at night! Another priority was open space in more than one area of the garden, good
        for throwing the frisbee, kicking a soccer ball, playing catch, hide-and-seek, laser tag,
        and more. Someone once said to the owners: “I’ve never seen a family use their pool as much
        as you all do.” The family’s children always wanted to hold their birthday parties by the
        pool, and pre-prom photos have been taken in their very own garden.

        Airlie is a premier waterfront garden of the coastal South and is especially stunning in the
        spring during the azalea season when thousands of blooms cover the plants. There is a
        balance of manicured and natural areas with a combination of formal gardens, walking trails,
        sculptures, views of Bradley Creek, two freshwater lakes, more than 100,000 azaleas and the
        grandeur of the magnificent Airlie Oak, which dates back to 1545 and is the North Carolina
        State Champion Live Oak. Not to be missed are a seasonal Butterfly House and unique Bottle
        Chapel, made using over 2,800 bottles, and is the centerpiece of the Minnie Evans Sculpture
        Garden.

        \n\nThe lovely scenery and ideal film locations in Airlie Gardens have also attracted many
        films and television shows over the years. One Tree Hill and Dawson’s Creek both feature
        scenes in the Pergola Garden and the ABC Family movie, A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song
        was filmed at the stable’s creek-side lawns.

        \n\nAs a coastal region site on the North Carolina Birding Trail, Airlie offers some of the
        best birding in New Hanover County. Check out Airlie’s HotSpot on eBird.com, a website which
        lists over 200 birds that have been viewed there and what is being seen on a daily basis.

        \n\nOPEN SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ONLY 10:00am to 5:00pm. Not open Friday. Parking available at
        the entrance to the garden.

        \n\nA special feature to visit is the Mount Lebanon Chapel, which was built in 1835 as a
        “chapel for ease” for summer residents on Wrightsville Sound. It is the oldest religious
        structure in New Hanover County and is open for worship services from Mother’s Day through
        Labor Day each summer. The chapel is open Saturday and Sunday only 10:00am to 5:00pm with
        docents. Maps are available from our ticket table at Airlie and pink arrows will direct you
        to this historic Chapel owned by St. James Episcopal Parish.

        For over fourteen years The Harbor Island Garden Club has planned, planted and maintained an
        award-winning public garden, which is dedicated to community, conservation, education and
        beautification. This acre of ground fosters multiple sections that contain coastal native
        trees, shrubs and perennials, which have been chosen to shelter and foster butterflies,
        birds and bees. In 2018, Hurricane Florence brought severe devastation to the grounds. The
        long recovery has created more sun exposure than the former shady canopy. Benches and a new
        swing by the cottage invite one to read or simply enjoy the soothing sounds of the central
        water garden while contemplating the surrounding memorial bricks and pavers. New and
        expanded areas include the labyrinth, which includes multiple fragrance enhancing roses and
        gardenias. Around the Circle Fountain are varieties of azaleas, camellias and shrubs that
        produce a variety of pink blossoms to focus on cancer awareness. In the picnic area, the
        cottage library is a certified lending collection of books for adults and children. Over the
        years, families have gathered for celebrations, Boy Scouts have installed Eagle Scout
        projects, trees have been planted for Arbor Day and pink ribbons hung from trees in October
        for breast cancer awareness. Floral arrangements created by members of the garden club will
        be displayed along the shade trail to complement and enhance the beauty of Harbor Way
        Gardens for the Tour.

        \n\n<i>The Plein Air art sale will take place at the Harbor Way Gardens from Noon to 4:00pm
        on Sunday, April 5, 2020.</i>

        “Peekin’ Through the Pines at Coral Cottage” is a garden, which was begun in 2007 using one
        and three gallon plants to develop a tapestry hedge for enclosure across the front of the
        property. Entering through the dooryard, weave your way under the dome of the native
        longleaf pines along the paths. You’ll find Moonwalker, Skywalker, Sandwalker, Perch Point,
        Fairy Landing, Figure 8, Heartsease, secret gardens and different styles of garden furniture
        and small sculptures tucked in among the shrubbery. A 250-foot mixed border runs from the
        front to the back and takes you to Scotland Yard and The Cathedral, including fifty-year old
        azaleas and newer camellias as well as an arbor covered in Lady Banks roses. In the
        Stockyard, harvested pine straw is stored which is spread in the beds in the spring once the
        composted live-oak leaves have been placed around all azaleas and camellias. The owner
        designs, installs and maintains the garden herself. Taking her inspiration from the Arts and
        Crafts style, she’s chosen to contrast the strong formal “bones” of the landscape with
        exuberant and loose plantings. Topiaries provide lovely focal points. The pine canopy
        provides filtered light, perfect for growing a wide variety of native and exotic plants. A
        new fence was designed to feature climbing roses, now able to benefit from newly abundant
        hours of sunshine after the loss of several pines. The owner’s motto is “Livin’ with
        Longleaf and Lovin’ It.”

        As the owners of the Thorpe Landscape Firm, this couple has the talent and expertise to
        create outstanding gardens. They leveled the existing site, which was in disrepair, with
        excavators and bobcats and redesigned all of the decks, walkways, and patios. You now enter
        into the beautifully maintained landscape of this classic Forest Hills cottage through a
        white picket fence. The symmetry of the plants along the front walk is pleasing to the eye.
        Ceiling fans and chairs create a cool and welcoming space on the front porch. They designed
        their entertainment area centered on the rock-floored fire pit. It is surrounded by an
        outdoor shower house, boat barn and Quonset hut shop. Well-placed lighting both front and
        back demonstrate how attractive illumination can be a successful part of garden design, that
        help create outdoor “rooms” as extensions of the house by evening. With kayaks at hand and a
        hammock swinging in the trees, this is an active outdoor family’s dream home.

        Upon entering the grounds, you immediately recognize the owner’s success in accomplishing
        their goal of creating an English-style garden using native plants. In the front yard, the
        entrance has a unique wrought iron scroll gate flanked by a low brick wall covered with a
        creeping fig vine. Neighbors and friends often stop by in the evening to sit on the wall or
        the nearby bench to chat. The driveway leads to a tall wooden fence where you will find a
        cozy backyard with a brick patio and comfortable sitting area by a fireplace. A winding
        pebble pathway leads you around a decorative birdbath, now planted with greens and
        surrounded by rose bushes. Further in the yard, another low brick wall creates a garden
        space that contains a new shed made from recycled material and old barn siding, which
        contains a hot tub. Close by is a pretty yellow bee house. In another corner of the backyard
        is a hammock and a signpost with arrows pointing in the direction of places they have
        visited and treasured. Watching wildlife that comes to visit regularly as a result of the
        plantings they add every year reminds the owner of the times he worked side by side with his
        grandfather in his garden. This is a certified wildlife habitat with many birdhouses in both
        the front and back yards. Despite the damage that last year’s hurricane did to the
        neighborhood and trees in both their front and back yard, this yard is back together and
        looking wonderful.

        This historic craftsman style bungalow built in 1923 beckons you up the steps to an entrance
        filled with potted plants. Turning to the left into the screened porch, you enter a tropical
        oasis, which spans the entire front of the house. Once inside, you see a wide variety of
        begonias and ferns artfully hanging or carefully displayed on antiques, ladders and benches.
        The eclectic furniture provides the perfect place for a morning cup of coffee or an evening
        glass of wine and an opportunity to admire the lush plants and miscellaneous “found” items
        on display. At the end of the front porch is a door that leads to an outside covered seating
        area with a cozy swing and more potted and hanging plants. Scotty previously worked at a
        large wholesale nursery where she acquired 100’s of plants, which she carefully relocated
        here. Scotty and her husband have created, planted, designed and continue to do all of the
        garden maintenance. The garden has limited sun, so the majority of the plants are shade
        lovers. Nestled in and among the plantings are “found” and collected items that add whimsy
        and interest such as flowers made from colored faucet handles, rusty whisky barrel hoops
        arranged over the plants to form an arch, a vintage door with a hanging basket filled with
        impatiens, a wonderful watering can collection and sunflowers made from old shoes from her

        Nestled on a quiet tree lined street, the historic colonial revival Frederick Pearsall House
        (1916), welcomes you through an artfully designed metal gate. Karen, the garden owner, is an
        artist whose sculptures and uniquely crafted pieces are placed throughout the property. The
        garden at the front of the house is designed as an English country courtyard with brick
        paths running between trimmed patches of Asiatic jasmine and bordered by a wonderful vintage
        wrought iron fence bordered with hellebores. The water from a lovely moss-covered fountain

        birdhouse is perched on a metal stand in the shape of a branch and a ceramic sculpture of a
        couple rests among the shade loving plants next to the terrace, which was created by the
        nationally recognized artist Virginia Gibbons. Additional art is represented by a sculpture

        Built in 1912, this historic prairie style home welcomes you to its spacious front porch
        featuring furniture built by the garden owner’s father. A lovely English Lutyens bench sits
        at one end of the porch under a vintage stained glass window creating an inviting place to
        sit and socialize. The side yard was already established when the garden owners bought the
        house in 2015. The backyard, however, was a blank canvas, which invited them to design and
        install their personalized oasis as an extension of their home. The outdoor room includes a
        large dining table and bench, also built by Donna’s father. It is constructed using rare old
        cypress from Louisiana. The room is well used by the garden owners and their family as a
        relaxing escape in the summer and a cozy warm space in the winter, sitting in front of the
        fireplace in the glow of antique gas lamps. Their love of all things historic, weathered
        with patina and collected in part from Legacy Historic Salvage, directed the design of the
        greenhouse built by Patrick, which includes a vintage sink and a shelf above it that holds
        various garden tools. Exotic tropical patio plants are maintained in the greenhouse during
        the winter. The sundial orb sits as the focal point of the raised bed vegetable garden and a
        metal arbor stands at the entrance to the garden. A fire pit is made from the end of an oil
        tanker truck, and vintage bottles adorn the “bottle tree” which adds a touch of whimsy. A
        shady area in a back corner of the yard holds a bench set among various plants where one
        might sit and admire the garden. In the backyard a small maple, a fig, and potted citrus
        trees given by friends and family are symbolic of this lovingly created home and garden.

    This graceful two-story historic house was built in 1907. After the house suffered severe fire
    damage in 1966, the current homeowners’ recognized an opportunity and bought and completely
    restored this home themselves. After renovation it was featured in the April 2012 issue of Wilma
    Magazine. A white picket fence softened with wisteria and roses looks spectacular and welcomes
    you to the home and garden. Rocking chairs are placed strategically on the front porch to
    encourage lounging and conversation. Strolling down the left side of the house on repurposed
    brick pathways is a formal pool on the left with an interesting swan based fountain backed by
    beautiful star jasmine on a raised picket fence. The path culminates with another striking
    three-tiered fountain, which cascades into a circular basin. As you cross the back garden there
    is a majestic Southern Magnolia defining the entrance to the gated pool complex that used to be
    a gravel parking lot. The salt-water swimming pool is the center of this wonderful entertainment
    complex. The luxurious cabana was designed and built by the homeowners. Tile from their
    renovated kitchen was carefully laid out and installed in the bas-relief fountain. The pool deck
    is filled with tropical containers, a bar and grilling station, seating areas and a fire pit
    providing a lush paradise for relaxation. This home and garden is always a delight and has been
    on a previous Azalea Festival Garden Tour along with the Candlelight Christmas Tour.

    \n\nNext door is a Greek Revival Style house originally built for Wilburn Trask, identified with
    an historic plaque that dates it to 1865. Painted a “sunny” yellow color with a bright blue
    door, this house has a similar porch with rocking chairs and a glider swing. Whimsical lighting
    under the painted porch roof adds an extra dose of charm. Two potted ferns sit on the front
    brick steps and plantings along the street and driveway are lush and beautiful. All of the
    colorful annuals in the front and side garden are maintained in pots to make them easy to
    maintain. Tucked into the cozy courtyard is a lovely back porch with rocking chairs and a white
    glider that overlooks the shady brick patio with its two distinct seating areas. The bench is
    set at an angle under a large tree with ferns lending a tropical feel, then a charming birdbath
    and at the end a small dining table under a colorful umbrella. This garden has a big impact and
    shows how much can be accomplished in a small space with color, design and style.

        Trees were always the owner’s first love and this eclectic woodland cottage, dubbed “Flower
        Gate,” now has over fifty varieties. Instead of a traditional lawn, the front yard is full
        of shade and greenery, much of it provided by dense low-hanging vines that loop throughout
        the property. Interestingly, the owner’s use of native honeysuckle, wisteria, Chilean potato
        vine and thorn-less blackberry was inspired by Tarzan films that she watched as a child. The
        front yard vines, intertwined with tiny, almost invisible lights, add charm and magical
        character. The owner wanted to create a 360-degree cloak of greenery with as much variety
        and shade as possible. She was influenced by the lives of her grandparents and great
        grandparents, who lived entirely off the land. This fueled her zeal to sculpt living green
        plantings to become a kind of urban camouflage. Degrees in design and art history helped
        guide her to create this tiny natural enclave, the perfect hideaway for many furry and
        feathered friends who can’t resist the setting. They live here abundantly, in a gated
        community for wildlife, rich in resources for them to dine, nest and frolic. Multiple garden
        areas can be entered through the ten different gates and arbors, which in turn open to
        settings full of antiques, rustic statues of critters and a variety of objects d’art
        collected throughout the years. At the base of “Bear Falls” a quiet waterfall flows into a
        pond filled with koi, adding another point of interest. The owner’s notion is that you can
        never have too many cats, plants or places to sit. This dream of a yard, with plenty of
        space for the outdoor lover, lives up to that belief.
